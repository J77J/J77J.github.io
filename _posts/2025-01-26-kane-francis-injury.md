## Kane Francis Groin Tear

Kane Francis, England's Strongest man, has suffered a grade 3 adductor tendon tear in his groin in a nightmare injury during training for the log press.

Francis sustained the devastating injury while performing a 172kg press during his competition preparation. The accomplished strongman described hearing a "pop" while completing tyhe lift and was immediately rushed to the emergency department, where he learned that he had most likely suffered a complete tear of the adductor longus.

Kane stated "I was training the log press... and as I pressed it over my head, I extended my leg and hips forward and felt this huge pop in my leg. I instantly knew that something bad had happened, because there was no pain. That made me instantly think it was a tendon."

## Prognosis and treatment

Kane was informed that he would need an MRI scan to confirm the injury, but as the NHS is stretched at the moment it would be a number of weeks before one could be arranged.

For a soft tissue injury MRI scans need to be performed when the injury is in its acute phase - ie quite soon after the injury, if it is left too long it is difficult or impossible to pinpoint the damage on the scan.

In addition to this, for an injury of this sort surgery has to be done as soon as possible after the initial injury or the tissue begins to shrink away from the injury site making it more difficult to reattach the separated tissues, so time is of the essence and a wait of months for the surgery on the NHS means a depressing prognosis as far as recovery goes.

Without quick treatment and surgery the injury Kane sustained could be, quite literally, career ending.

## Fundraiser

Evans Nana another high ranking Strongman and close friend of Kane has set up a fundraiser on gofundme which can be found on his <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/england-strongest-man-get-his-adductor-longus-fixed">gofundme page</a>.

We wish Kane the best of luck with his ongoing recovery.
